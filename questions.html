Colleague, Local, Friend<br>
Identify if talking would be fun time spent<br>
1.      What's your job like<br>
2.      How do you view customers<br>
3.      Do you worry about losing your job<br>
4.      Are your weeks the same, years<br>
5.      Did you ever consider if your life is getting harder, or work is getting harder<br>
6.      What's your spiritual life like Church or churches, many or a few. Youth groups. Trials and tribulations
<P>
Get to know from a timeless perspective<br>
1.      What skills and sayings have been in your family. Me: life’s not fair, write things out on a big sheet of paper<br>
2.      How many friends do you have<br>
3.      Do you write things down<br>
4.      What is a bad or good discipline you apply to yourself Me: GRE preparation<br>
5.      Has anything taken you so long, that you repeatedly do, but hasn’t completed or turned out yet. Like my budget file. Like popularity, cool, not cool contests again, like in high school.<br>
6.      Have you ever been to any funerals<br>
7.      How much time do you spend alone<br>
8.      Has anyone ever said something random, related to your surroundings, where the timing, and the consideration or personal view, something you treasure, is randomly involved and it feels like a surprise cut to the gut from someone who is seemingly blameless or maybe they are knowingly hurting you<br>
9.      Do you ever have days where you are on quite worried about something that is very strange, and then annoying yourself and others, because it's hard to ignore, or a feeling of being a little ganged up on, or fail on something you used to care about<br>
10.   What kind of real world dreams do you have<br>
11.   Has anyone ever broken into your apartment<br>
12.   Have you ever felt like you have reliably applied wisdom, or conquered a big trial. Seems like I only recognize when I fail a trial or tribulation, and a few that pass, are corny<br>
13.   Do you ever want to run away but also think, running away is going to be worse off<br>
<P>
Short Interview Questions<br>
1.      Do you have a backup plan<br>
2.      Where did you live the longest. What type of housing<br>
3.      Are you around people you like<br>
4.      Who have you met within the past few months who you consider to have a pretty good life<br>
5.      Compared to people you grew up with, are you around them still<br>
6.      Are you around similar people, or are you familiar with what they do Day to Day<br>
7.      Do you have 7 coworkers you can describe<br>
8.      How many jobs have you applied to. Can you recall a few specific examples<br>
9.      When people say things, do you sometimes give in to, explore, flashbacks<br>
10.     What's the most delicate thing. If not the most, can you name a few things that are delicate. Like starting a new relationship
